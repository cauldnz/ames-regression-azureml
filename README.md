# A tutorial on Ames Housing dataset using Azure Machine Learning Studio.
A worked example of using Azure ML for the Ames Housing regression problem.

This uses the [Ames Housing Dataset](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) 
Journal of Statistics Education, Volume 19, Number 3(2011) 

Is designed to provide output suitable for submission to the corresponding [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
We have done a bunch of dataset cleansing already to impute NAs etc.

We originally wrote this in our team to teach some non technologists a bit about machine learning... We hope that it's helpful to others in teaching some of these concepts.

Includes
- Loading data
- Basic correlation analysis
- Training a Boosted Decision Tree Regression model
- Cross Validation
- Hyper parameter optimization
- Feature engineering using R and Python
